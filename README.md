# CollabCode - Collaborative Code Editor

## Overview

CollabCode is a modern collaborative code editor leveraging **Socket.io** for real-time code collaboration and integrating **Gemini AI** for AI-powered coding assistance. Users can interact with Gemini AI during editing sessions by starting their messages with `@ai`. The application is built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and incorporates various technologies to ensure seamless functionality.
